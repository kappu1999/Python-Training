    "**Class variable −** A variable that is shared by all instances of a class. Class variables are defined within a class but outside any of the class's methods. Class variables are not used as frequently as instance variables are.\n",

    "**Data member −** A class variable or instance variable that holds data associated with a class and its objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function overloading −** The assignment of more than one behavior to a particular function. The operation performed varies by the types of objects or arguments involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instance variable −** A variable that is defined inside a method and belongs only to the current instance of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inheritance −** The transfer of the characteristics of a class to other classes that are derived from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instance −** An individual object of a certain class. An object obj that belongs to a class Circle, for example, is an instance of the class Circle.\n",

Class instances can also have methods (defined by its class) for modifying its state.\n",

If a list is used, the first element could be the dog’s breed while the second element could represent its age. Let’s suppose there are 100 different dogs, then how would you know which element is supposed to be which? What if you wanted to add other properties to these dogs? This lacks organization and it’s the exact need for classes.\n",
